Project Specification Feedback
==================

Commit graded:

### The product backlog (10/10)

The product backlog is detailed and complete. You should assign each small task to a single person. Two minor advice: 1) present the backlog using spreadsheet. It is easy to track and will help you follow to update of the requirements; 2) estimate the cost of each task. That will help you split the task equally, also track the total progress.

### Data models (9/10)

For now, your data model is clear. You should provide more details about the models. You should briefly explain how each model is used in its scenarios. For example, why Band and SongList both have the 'has' relationship to the Event.

### Wireframes or mock-ups (10/10)

The wireframes are clean and easy-to-understand in general.
